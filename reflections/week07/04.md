## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

  We implemented paired programming, a little bit of user story / UX design when discussing how our front end should look. A large concept this week and what I wanted to better understand myself was relational data models. In the paired programming project we did finally get relational data drawing to the page with an hour or so of extra work after class.

2. What went well this week?

  I think in regards to the partner project we did really good switching off so both of us got some driving and navigating experience. I think both positions are very helpful in retaining the information we are learning at such a fast pace.

3. What would you do differently?

  I think next time it would be helpful to start implementing some of the simpler big picture things on hte front end as we wrapped up the needed backend logic.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

While today we are working on our checkpoint, I ahve linked the paired programming project from earlier in the week. I really like paired programming, it's a lot easier to think and understand exactly what we are working through.
