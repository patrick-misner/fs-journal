## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

  You can document within the code file / source. You can write a readme on the repo and also you could write a how to on any other shareable platform such as a wiki, onenote, document, sharepoint etc.

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

  One major benefit is it can make the code and past labor useful to your team. It will be useful to the person who wrote the code and useful to future employees or your replacement in the future. I am a big fan of documentation, it can save time for two people if written well and it can save the day long after you are gone from a company. It also can help immensely with being rehired, perhaps if you are not getting along well at the new job. 

3. How important is Code documentation and why?

  Because we are humans, instructions and documentation written out in plain english can be very helpful even to the person who wrote the code. If you don't use it for even a few weeks you may be confused as to what is expected in the parameters or what the function is even for.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today we worked on a relational data model and drawing some data to hte page, it can be hard to switch from back to front end. A big take away from today was to always save your postman requests, and we learned a lot about setting up queries on the back and front end for a simple many-many table. It is making a lot of sense to me but also making the many-many-many data model even more intimidating.
