## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

  Often referred to as UX, it's how the users interact with the business. You should ask what the user wants to do and keep anything generally under 5 steps.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

  Users can tell when their experience is considered. They won't be confused and stick around the web page and likely your conversion rates will be higher.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

  As a user myself, if your website or application is confusing and aesthetically not pleasing I will not last long. I will quickly go somewhere else to find what I am looking for. A good user experience is critical if not the most important thing in your applications.. Whether it's a potential customer, colleague or c-level using the application, you want them to satisfied functionally and aesthetically.
