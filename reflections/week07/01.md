## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

  Paired programming is two people coding together on one workstation. One is the driver, typing out the code and hte other is a navigator. The navigator and driver are constantly communicating next steps and what the programming logic is actually doing.

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

  The navigator gets to focus on the big picture, seeing where we are at in the code, thinking about the next steps and they get experience talking with the driver is doing and why. The driver is getting experience writing out the code and can focus better and not be distracted by the big picture. The navigator gets to use left brain while the programer uses right brain and neither have to struggle or take time to switch modes.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

  Some aspects of paired programming can slow the work down, or a personality clash or disagreement of best practice/organization can hinder progress. If one of the two would rather work alone or listen to music loudly or on ear buds it can defeat the value of paired programming.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

After just a week or two of not touching the backend it was difficult to remember the structure and syntax but I feel like it went a lot smoother than even the end of week5 when we had spent an entire week learning it.
