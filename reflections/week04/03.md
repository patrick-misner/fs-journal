## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?

They make code appear synchronous but behind the curtain it is asynchronous and non blocking. The rest of your code can run while an async function is waiting for a response or taking extra time. Async await internally creates a promise.

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?

You must run prefix the function with async.

Such as "async doThing(){
  await api.get.function
}"

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?

The code is much simpler to read than a chain of promises or callbacks. The async functions can be chained easily
