## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Promises states are as follows:
 1) pending
 2) resolved
 3) rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

with multiple async functions we can attach callbacks to promises instead of passing them all. It can make for much cleaner code.


3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

a .then is for resolved promises and catch is for rejected promises. If we get a resolved promise chances are we run a promise.then to execute the next bit of code. If the promise is rejected then we want to catch it.
