# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  It was a shorter week but I feel like running gets, posts, puts and deletes against an API has really been hammered in.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  That we all would be capable of building something that hits multiple APIs without much help.

- What are you struggling with?

A little bit of struggles on where I should run
functions inside the MVC pattern. I wrote a couple functions in the model to get the data how I wanted it.. Now I'm wondering if I could have just run those functions on the actual model's class.

- What would you count as a victory?

I am proud of my clock and weather displays on the checkpoint. I'm sure there are cleaner or better ways to do it but I was amazed I could get the results I wanted for the assignment. I even went back through and refactored like 6+ gets for celsius and fahrenheit from kelvin to two simple functions. (I was getting current temp and high+low for the day)
