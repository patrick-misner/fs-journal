> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

a massive glob of code with 5+ "})" stacked at the end. A developer trying to get their code to run in the exact order needed without using all the tools available. A cause could be a sign of a experienced programmer that is new specifically to javascript

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

If you call a function inside of a function, or execute a function defined afterwards it is a callback. Since Javascript executes code from top to bottom, you can use callbacks to manage the order in which they are executed. If you don't know how long a function is going to take and it will take some time, then callbacks aren't as useful and that's where async comes in to save the day by waiting for the results of a block of code.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

One way would be to use async if a function does take an uncertain amount of time. A second way would be to keep your code clean and shallow and easy to understand. Lastly, using try/catch on any async where and external query is involved.
