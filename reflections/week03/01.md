## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

  It makes the modules accessible to other javascript files. Your exported code can have access to private/inaccessible code as well. It can increase performance where the exported code is not needed.

<!-- maybe need some help understanding this. -->
2. How does export differ from export default?

  Export Default are often used to export a singular variable with value and gives you the possibility of having a default value for the js file doing the import to fall back on. It seems to be a confusing and debated topic on when to use one or the other. If you're exporting just a single class or function, import default is suggested and to use a regular export for multiple functions / variables.

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

  One important aspect to me seems like a boost in performance. You no longer need to load up JS files and blocks of JS that are not needed. The module system also segregates code very well so you are not effecting the functionality of the entire application, typically just the feature. Modules keep your JS code clean and easy to ready, and can point you in a more specific direction during debugging and potentially keep multiple code contributors from stepping on each other.
