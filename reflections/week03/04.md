> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

  It helps with having large amount of one way functions that update data (arrays/objects). Minimizes added lines of code and complications when creating/updating or querying data.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

  There is the subscribe method, the unsubscribe method and broadcast method. You can subscribe to events by pushing objects/functions into the built observers object. You can unsubscribe functions from the observers object. You can broadcast to all subscribers by iterating through the observers and notifying each "subscriber".

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

From what I can understand using and looking at the bcw template we can use the ProxyState.on('array', _function) as a listener on a specific array / object defined in the appstate. Any time we use an assignment operator on that object we can define a function we want to run. This allows us to avoid calling a draw or update function over and over again at the correct time or sequence with each function / feature we implement handling data within the object/array in the Appstate.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I learned about the difficulties of drawing HTML with java that has data from another array. After realizing how this is accomplished I feel a lot better about working with relational objects. Using the get method in the parent's model, we can extract, manipulate, and display data from a "child" object/array.
