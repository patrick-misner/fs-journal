## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

    Encapsulation mitigates timing dependencies in a programming language. It also serves as a tool to protect and hide the codebase from a user facing application.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

A lot of javascript developers didn't use or know about closures. Developers only noticed there was no way to create a private property for an object. Instead of using closures, developers started using a "_"in front of a function to denote that it is private. It was not a standard and other developers that weren't aware of the purpose of the "_" began using these _ prefixed functions where they should not and breaking the codebase.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Any variables you define in a constructor within an ES6 class will be private. So they don't get put in memory when they are not needed and so the outside world / users doesn't have access to the data in the object.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working with MVC can get super confusing and mistakes are easily made. It definitely highlights the importance of what CodeWorks has been drilling in to my head, "code small, test small". I'm hoping to get faster but navigating the new file structure definitely has slowed me down.
