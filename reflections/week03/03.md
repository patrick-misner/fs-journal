## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

  Two operations commonly set in the handler are the get and set function. The get operator has two arguments, the object and the object's property being accessed.The set operator has three arguments, the object, the object's property and the value to be assigned.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

  You need to make sure you are using the return operator, such as "return object[object property]". If you don't use return then it'll overwrite the default implementation of a Get and give us "undefined".

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

  One benefit is you can make particular properties private that do not need to be accessed from the front end. You can also set up constrains for Sets, like making sure the proper data type is being inserted in to the object. Proxy can also make sure the object has all the right properties.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Working through the model, controller, service and appstate can be really confusing at first but it's becoming more intuitive on where to go for the logic I need to implement. Even though
it is painful right now, I can see the many benefits of structuring applications in this way. One thing that comes to mind is multiple people working on separate features at once.
