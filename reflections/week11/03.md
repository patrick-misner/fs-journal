## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?

  It is a vulnerability in web applications where someone can execute sql commands through any user input field, url etc on your web application

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

 A matrix neo hacker can input SQL statements into an input field in a form that can hit your database if you are not sanitizing user inputs. They can also inject SQL into their local cookies that your webserver will load. They can also use the URL path to inject sql if your webserver uses part of the web address for variables.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

You can use automated testing tools like SQL Map, to test and sanitize your input. IDS(intrusion detection systems) can detect sql injection attempts. Lastly a firewall can detect and block sql injection attacks but shouldn't be the only measure.
