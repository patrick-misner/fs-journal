## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is the unique identifying column/field in the local table, and the foreign key is the local field that references the primary key for a separate table.

2. What is an `Alias`?

  An Alias is just a new name for column field in the returned select query. Commonly used when both tables have a field with the same name, example: local id versus classroomId.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

I am renaming the many-many table to doctorpatient

    SELECT
    dp.id AS doctorpatientId,
    p.id AS patientId, p.name AS patientName
    FROM patients p
    JOIN doctorpatient dp ON p.id = dp.patientId
    WHERE dp.doctorId = 3


```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name (varchar255),
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name (varchar255),
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctorpatient (
  id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id)
)

```
