## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


The Boise Codeworks immersive full-stack development course has been an absolutely fantastic experience. The staff is incredibly helpful and patient, and have clearly developed effective ways to explain and provide understanding for the students on any concepts taught throughout the course. I will admit it has been stressful and I've wanted to pull my hair out on some projects but I always come out with a whole new level of understanding of the code or frameworks we were working with. I came to this course from a decade of IT on very small teams so going back to school full time after 16+ years was definitely a struggle. I was very introverted at first but I am coming out of this with some new friends, new confidence and an enhanced passion for the field of software development.

The final project is intimidating because the stakes are high and I really want to make it through and feel good about the work I've done on the final. I feel great and confident about completing the C# backend but I am definitely worried about Vue. I still struggle a bit on when and where to run my API calls and update the App State but I did much better with allspice ( the previous checkpoint ) than all the other vue projects in the regard and design as well.

Getting to know the staff and the group project (capstone) I think were the highlight for me. I believe talking through the code and what it is or should be doing with peers is probably the most effective learning tool for me.
