## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.


The Codeworks course has been absolutely fantastic. The staff is incredibly helpful and patient and have clearly developed effective ways to explain and provide understanding for the students on any concepts taught throughout the course. I will admit it has been stressful and I've wanted to pull my hair out on some projects but I always come out with a whole new level of understanding what we were working on. Going back to school full time was definitely a struggle and I was quite shy but I am coming out of this with some new friends and an enhanced passion for the field of software development.

The final project is intimidating because the stakes are high and I really want to make it through and feel good about the work I've done. I feel great and confident about completing the C# backend but am worried about Vue. I still struggle a bit on when and where to run my API calls and update the App State but I did much better with allspice ( the previous checkpoint ) than all the other vue projects in the regard and design as well.

Getting to know the staff and the group project (capstone) I think were the highlight for me. Talking through the code and what it is or should be doing with peers is probably the most effective learning tool for me.
