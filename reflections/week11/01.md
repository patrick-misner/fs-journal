## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

  Inheritance not only helps remove duplicate code, it also serves as a kind of rule set for the child / derived class. This helps keep human coders from forgetting things.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

  A derived/child class does not inherit all members of a base/parent class. Constructors are not inheritable and neither are finalizers.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

  derived/child class inheritance is dependent on the accessibility set in the base/parent. private is not visible to for derived classes. Protected and internal members are visible ONLY to child classes and public is accessible even for unrelated classes.

I tried to apply some of the learnings about many-many tables to my allspice checkpoint.
