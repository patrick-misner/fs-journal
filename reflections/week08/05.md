# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  I think we did a great job planning out how our application should work. We went back and created a prototype with our figma and it poked a lot of holes in our design and allowed us to write a better data model.


- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  How hard it is to run a function on Appstate data coming from an async / awaited API Call.

- What are you struggling with?

  Vue implementations, when do I run functions as onmounted, watcheffect, computed, over the other.  


- What would you count as a victory?

  My biggest victory was getting the vue3datepicker component installed and working and disabling week days based on an availability object with weekday, time values.
