## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

    This allows employers to see where your skills are at and what your capable of. It can showcase how much time you've spent and the technologies you are comfortable with.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

    5 examples of you taking a real world problem and developing an application to solve those problems. Good design and functionality and whether the tools are easy to use. This is kind of what I plan on shooting for.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

  I think I would include Tower, the last checkpoint we did and wayfinder. Tower I think is a really good example of understanding and implementation of relational data. Wayfinder I am particular proud of my design and implementation of bootstraps main functions. It also has a good example of nested data. (tasks inside of Trips)

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I am confident in our ability to come up with a structure we can safely implement. Working on the full figma is  harder and more time consuming than it seems. Today definitely highlighted the importance of a great foundational plan for an MVP (minimum viable product).
