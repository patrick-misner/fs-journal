## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - Testing of a smaller manageable section of code on your vue application. Done with two main libraries, Mocha and Jest.

Component Testing - Must be done while mounted to the DOM. This is for testing individual components.

End to End testing (E2E) - This method is used when testing the entire application, to test the full functionality from the end-user's perspective.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

  I think E2E is the most useful and clear, although I could see in some situations how this could be a burden or time sink. It can be painful to run through E2E tests especially if different roles / permissions are involved on the user end.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

  To me unit testing seems like the least useful to isolate and define. With the training I've received at codeworks I feel like this is already done during the code writing process. At least, I would never be comfortable write more than 10 lines of code without testing or logging to ensure I was on the right track, even I wrote the same code 15 times already. If I thought it was done, I would test some more.
