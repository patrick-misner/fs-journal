## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

    Communication is everything, the upfront time cost is there, but it can save hours of coding and complex work down the line. If I don't understand how exactly a field in a data model is to be used I could be developing software in the complete wrong way. This goes for every bit of coding/functions that we are doing. How the app works must be agreed upon and understood.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

  This would be creating a hybrid approach. Optimize communication patterns with the customer/product owner and scrum team. Getting everyone to agree on compromises on product complications and what the MVP will look like. Other small changes can be made and tested to see if progress increases.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

  I actually think this unattainable triangle is not clear at all. This is really similar to a truth about cars. You can have fast/reliable/cheap, you only get two of these options. I think the same could be said about an application but replace reliable with good. The caveat that only two can be picked makes the tradeoffs implicit. This is a great way to get everyone on the team to be realistic about what can be achieved with the budget and timeline.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

It is so damn easy to completely fail to communicate even in a small team. Day one we had businesses table/collection scratched off the data model and mid presentation you find out the collection is back. When you are simply a member/junior of a team and you are struggling to communicate something it may be completely necessary to pull in someone with a leadership role to get things corrected. It's not that we can't but we just may not have the authority or final say to get people on the same page.
