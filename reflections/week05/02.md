## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

  DB Tables relationships can be one to one, one to many, and many to many.
  One to one being something such as comments and posts. Your comments are only contain one specific post ID that is generated for every post in the posts table table.

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

  When you embed a data model into another you risk growing the table too large and poor write performance. Another problem is you have to retrieve the whole document, and cannot filter the comments.


3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

  There are multiple ways to embed in the many-many relationships but it seems like a third collection to manage the relationships is the simplest way for me to understand and it seems easier to query. The third collection is like a join table, with IDs from the other two tables.
