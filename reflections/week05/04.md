## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?

  A virtual property on a data model is a fake property that is queried from somewhere else it doesn't actually exist in the mongo document but appears with some logic.

2. When might you use a virtual property? 

  It seems to me it's a way to make queries on the front end a little easier. Instead of hitting multiple documents I could get the name of a user who made an object when an object truly only stores the users ID. Another way is forming a Full name field based on the first and last name.

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?

  It seems like you cannot search or filter by virtual property, you can only display that virtual data when searching on the object containing the virtual property.
