> **ðŸ“– [Using Query Parameters](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/01-Query-Parameters)**

## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

  To retrieve or send specific data to or from a restful api. You may want to find or submit objects that have a specific key=value and it can be accomplished with a query string.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

  It starts with a question mark and you enter the key=value after that. An example being api/cars?color=red. This will get all cars where the color property is red.

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

  Definitely very useful relational data, such as finding all child objects in a parent. You can pass a query to the getAll of the child's service on the server side and very useful for sorting/filtering data on the front end.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

It can definitely be confusing going from MVC pattern front end to back end. I'm working with controllers and services again but having to learn to write them in an entirely different way.
