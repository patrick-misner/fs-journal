## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

  It is a simple time management technique. You estimate a length of time for a given task and stick to it.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

  I definitely need to implement strategic quitting, it can be easy to get frustrated and keep attacking a problem when a break is needed. I want to be a little flexible, depending of the complexity of the problem, I can spend more time if it's simpler. Lastly, prioritize my tasks sometimes that may involve a question to a lead, if I have too much on my plate it could be unwise to spend the limited time on something less important to the business.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

  One time, I got stuck on making a button work and it was really frustrating. I realized I had been working on something simple for far too long and decided to stop. I got help but I would have taken a good mental break.
