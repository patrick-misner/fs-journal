## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

2. What is Hoisting ?

  Hoisting is where you define a variable within the invoke console.log(variable) and javascript will run that variable definition before the line of code, console.log in this case.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

I'm not sure, I feel like using const could be useful for a persistent value or a modifier but if you simply don't update your let variable, the result would be the same. Var variables don't seem to be incredibly useful either, I can't see why I would need to redeclare a variable, just update it and use let variables.

setting element text or values based on javascript data is kind of hard, depending on the data type, strings are easier to remember how to do.

document.getElementByID("elemID").innerText = numberVariable.toString()
