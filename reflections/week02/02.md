## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

  1. function declaration
function name(parameters){
  //statements
}

  2. function expression
let name = function(parameters) {
  //statements
}

  3. arrow function
let name = (parameters => {
  //statements
})

In a function declaration, the function is hoisted, so the function is usable before it is defined. IE: you can run the function in a line o code above where the function is defined.

A function expression can be named or anonymous(no name?). These are not hoisted so you cannot run call/execute the function on any lines above the function expression.

Arrow functions do not create their own THIS value. Arrow function also is simply shorthand for a function expression so they are also not hoisted.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are names/variables created in the function definition. Arguments come later, they are the values the function gets from the parameters when the function is invoked/called/executed.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Yo dog, I heard you like functions.

inserting a function as a parameter in another function would elevate that function to a higher order function.

I think function from guessWHO I adapted to get the package to name is an example of a higher order function? 
Because I have a function defining the parameter "to"?

function findPackage(to){
  let found = activePkgs.find(p => p.to == to)
  console.log(found)
  if(found.to == lostPkg.to){
    // window.alert(`You found the lost package!`)
    successPopup()
