## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

  It seems with no plan, your code can end up not being very expandable. With javascript in mind, when writing a function if you write out the desired goals and think for a bit, you can get away with less lines or possibly less functions.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

  In regards to writing code, a few things have helped me. 
    1. looking at all the option I can do inside of intellisense
    2. shelving the problem, putting something in one note and asking the question to a developer. 
    3. taking a break (long one if I've been working for several hours already). Before going to bed, something clicked in my brain and I realized I was trying to define a variable inside of a function with moody kittens.
    4. Google but knowing WHAT to google. I learned how to add and remove attributes on an HTML element with JS, before this class my search would've been a lot broader.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

  There were a few sections where he's talking about bad code and giving examples of some loops etc. I did not understand the code at all so his advice was hard to take in. The article made me realize the importance of testing, taking your time writing the code and taking breaks.
