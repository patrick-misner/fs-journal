## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

If I'm understanding this right, you can manually write info to the console with devtools, or have it read console.logs you wrote from your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Element tab can allow you to see the HTML CSS code, and you can even modify it to see changes in real time.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

Potentially a really good way to debug your code would be to insert the debugger function into your javascript and chrome will freeze on that line and allow you to run through the code line by line. You can also right click and add a line break to the line number to the left of the line. This is done in sources tab after selecting the javascript file.
