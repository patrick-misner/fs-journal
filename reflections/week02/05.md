# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
  
  That after a week of HTML/CSS and a week of JS I could make a stand alone app that looked decent and actually worked as intended.

- What are you struggling with?

  Memorizing structure of the different types of loops, lambda and (truthy/falsey?) I need more practice with these.

- What would you count as a victory?

  I think Thursday's assignment, my partner coded and I backseat drove / assisted with the logic. It was a blast and getting things working together and was very satisfying. We ended up finishing with a web app functioning mostly as intended. I enjoyed it a lot more than coding alone in silence and it seemed faster. I do wonder and worry about annoying my partner in these situations as a contributor. Maybe it's less of a problem with more complicated applications or something to do with being new? Am I helping my partner, or making it confusing? Is the way I want to do it different from their approach? I can't wait to get more experience working with others on FS development.
