## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    A Pseudo class to me seems like an action on the element. Definitely have used hover for a style change on buttons in past code alongs.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

  I could see styling a multiple child elements with an ID, and overwriting a default css settings for a common tagname.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

    Using the !important feature would make style changes much harder to implement. If multiple css selectors used it, it could be difficult to even know why style wasn't applying, and take time to update styles or write entirely new selector statements.
