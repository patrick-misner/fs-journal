# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  I think jumping right into trying to code and making many mistakes helped me learn.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  

- What are you struggling with?

  Definitely still trying to wrap my head around the bootstrap and their container, row, col model. When to use display flex or display block alignment etc. With enough experimenting I can get what I want but it is definitely not intuitive, hoping that will come with time.

- What would you count as a victory?

  I feel really good about the thursday afternoon project and first checkpoint. It took me a lot of time outside of class but hands on with real world tools and languages is a lot more engaging than any other studying and education I've had in the past.
