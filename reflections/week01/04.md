## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

    Simplify transitioning screen sizes with modern design.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

I'm definitely guessing here but I'm thinking the levels of wire frames are container, row, column? If used correctly, BS CSS Classes can be assigned at higher levels and simplify and speed up design. The contents inside a col will always fit to the proper part of the page.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Learning bootstraps container, row, col logic has been frustrating but I definitely understand the need and value. Once it is done, changing content and design (colors etc) seems more fluid.

There are many approaches to get the high res design you want but not all of them are even remotely easy to transition to mobile. Designing mobile first really starts to make sense.
