## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

    Organize information and develop a design goal with your coding.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Seems like you may have different levels of wire frame design, a basic rough draft, and higher and higher fidelity versions. It seems like this could significantly speed up the build process as you aren't hung up on placement and details.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

I believe they are. It gives you an outline and goal to reach with your coding instead of spending extra time experimenting with code over a simple drawing.
