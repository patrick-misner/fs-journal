## Questions

1. What are props?

  Props are like variables that can be passed from parent components to child components example (blog page component > blog component > blog form). They can contain objects with many properties, as well as arrays, objects, booleans, strings and numbers

2. What are props used for?

  We can use props to pass data to child components. This is so the child component has access to the prop, or the data we wanted to pass. An example would be in the HomePage where we return data in the AppState under the export and setup, we add a Prop with v-bind or : and set that prop's value to an object in an array. The child component can then take in that prop under the export default, give it a name, define the data type and require.


3. Where can props be used or accessed?

  Props inside parent components can be accepted/imported into child components. Then, inside of the child component accepting the prop we can access it in the template, or pass the prop into setup(props) and use the props data on our methods.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Reaching out to APIs has now become the easy part. The syntax for export default on vue pages is very different from what I am used to. However, I can really see how much this can improve build time of the foundation of an Application once I am more comfortable with the framework.
