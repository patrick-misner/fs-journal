## Questions

1. What is a nested route?

  A nested route is adding children to a predefined route. You can use this to keep track of where the user is at and have rules and capture parameters. Example: A profile page with a posts component.

2. When might you use a nested route? (other than the provided example)

  I may use a nested route for components in a component, the profile page and a contact details section or an edit profile section.

3. Can you pass parameters through nested routes? When might you use them?

  Yes you can pass parameters on all routes, you may set an ID to this.$route.params and capture that parameter on the component defined in that route. I believe we did this for the profile page in artTerminal.
