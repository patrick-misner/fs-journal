## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

  lifecycle hooks are methods used to inject code into a part of the vue initialization, render and destroy process.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

  Yes, I have used onmounted to trigger a method that gets data from an API. I have also used onBeforeUnmount to close a modal out. 

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

  mounting hooks are methods to inject pieces of code that run before or after the page render is complete. You could use them to load data before the render, or perform an action right after the render or when closing or moving away from the page.
