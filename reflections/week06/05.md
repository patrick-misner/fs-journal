# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  I was happy with the thurs partner project. I always feel like i learn and retain knowledge better when talking it through with a partner.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  How hard it is to get used to a frameworks syntax. It is frustrating to see the value and speed it can bring but be so slow at it.

- What are you struggling with?

  Definitely struggling with moving code into components. I'm never sure exactly what data I need to pass / bring in on the component. Do I need a prop? Can I pull from the AppState? I have only really found value with props when doing a loop/draw template so far.

- What would you count as a victory?

  Vue is really hard for me to understand and I feel like I'm hanging on by a thread. I feel like the big picture things are embedding into memory, like doing a v-for passing a prop to a component that represents the single object in an array.
