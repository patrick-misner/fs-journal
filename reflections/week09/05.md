# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

  I feel like we had a good start on Tuesday after getting back on track Monday. As the week progressed I and I think the rest of my team were starting to burn out.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

  How hard it is to manipulate inbound and outbound data with a few complexities in it on a form. It was a massive struggle for me Friday.

- What are you struggling with?

  Again, when and where to run fucntions. How to load make a component wait for some data set to load etc.

- What would you count as a victory?

  We deployed our app to heroku and everything appears to be working.  While we were a bit slow and the app could use some more finalizing touches and a little better logic, we made it through and my team got along pretty well the entire process.
