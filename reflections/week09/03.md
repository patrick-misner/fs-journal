## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

    It is an image that has been converted from binary data to ASCII text.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

    It hurts your SEO since they are not accessible via URL. The image is 25% bigger using more bandwidth. The clients cannot cache the image either so slower load times on revisits.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

    base64 was introduced when web browsers had a limit on concurrent connections. This is no longer an issue after multiplexing was introduced in HTTP/2 just 6 years ago.
