## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using a nodeJS backend with mongoose and document database called MongoDB. The frontend is a reactive JS framework Vue3. My team also installed a component called vue3 datepicker with a ton of features we needed to block out certain weekdays. If I'm understanding right, the principles we are using are agile/scrum for productivity and git for change/version control.

2. What went well so far?

  I think our group had great communication which led to better productivity due to knowing what needs to be done and who was working on what. We did not have to waste time to fight merge conflicts or broad design decisions.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

  I think I'd speak up a little more as I feel like sometimes we would get led down overly complicated rabbit holes that I could see coming but was not confident enough about my understanding of the amount of time something would take us.
