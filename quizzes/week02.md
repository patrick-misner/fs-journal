# Intro to JavaScript

**1.** Which keywords are used to declare a variable in JavaScript?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
let, var and const. Let cannot be redfined, var can and is not recommended. Const for any variables that are constant, not changing.
```
**2.** What is the definition of a function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A function is a stored and executable block of code.
```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I do not know.
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
2, because array's index start at zero.
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
<!-- NOTE Am I right here? I didn't do a lot of pushing -->
```
 I don't know off the top of my head, looking back at ice cream parlor.
 I believe I would do them.push(you.friends)

```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
if (price > currentMoney){
  console.log('you cannot afford this')
}

```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
  // NOTE need help understanding this.
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
This is the part of the for loop that runs every time, the term before this is the conditional. I do not know the name. i++ is what goes there
```

```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Document Object Model. index.html if a file is not specified in the http request.
```

**9.** What are the `9` ECMAScript types as defined by MDN?
<!-- NOTE What do they mean by LOWEST level? like closest to the 0s and 1s? or opposite? -->
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I have no idea what the MDN or ECMAScript is, I did try and research this.

It appears MDN is mozilla developer network and the ECMAScript is a standard in which different browsers will execute javascript.

The 9 ECMAscript types are as follow:

1. Primitive Values (includes the 8 below, is the lowest level)
  2. Boolean type
  3. Null type
  4. Undefined type
  5. Number type
  6. BigInt type
  7. String type
  8. Symbol type
9. Objects

```
**10.** When it comes to functions or methods, what is the difference between a `parameter` and an `argument`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
<!-- NOTE curious if I'm right here. -->
```
An argument contains some logic and operators and a parameter is a simple/singular data input.

```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- NOTE Are arrays objects? -->
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```

primitive values / data types are simple, null, undefined, boolean, string, number.
Reference values are stored in objects, arrays? Are arrays objects?
